20.1.03 Practice: Mouse Events
```
**Outcomes:**

* **1.2.1 Identify the types of subprograms supported by the environment:** Event-driven procedures (`mousePressed`, `mouseDragged`) are built-in modular components.
* **3.6 Debug programs using appropriate techniques.**

### **1. Move the Circle**

Start with:

```javascript
let x = 200;
let y = 200;
```

Each time you click, move the circle so it follows your mouse position.

---

### **2. Grow on Drag**

When you **drag** your mouse, make the circle’s **size get bigger** the farther to the right you drag.
(Hint: use `mouseDragged()` and `mouseX`.)

---

### **3. Click Counter**

Every time you click, add +1 to a counter and show it on the screen using `text()`.

---


### **4. Console Test**

Write a simple program that prints `"Clicked!"` in the console every time the mouse is pressed.
(Hint: use `print()` inside `mousePressed()`.)

---

### **5. Light or Dark**

Make the circle’s fill colour darker when you drag near the **bottom** of the screen, and lighter near the **top**.
(Hint: `fill(0, 0, 255, mouseY / 2)`.)
