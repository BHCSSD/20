> [!NOTE]
> ## INFODUMP:
> In programming, a **flag variable** is a variable that keeps track of a **condition**, usually whether something **has happened** or not. 
> * It’s called a “flag” because it **raises a signal** in your code when a certain event occurs.
> 
> Think of it like a switch: `true` means “yes, this happened,” and `false` means “no, it hasn’t happened yet.”

### **TODO**

We want to **change the colour of a circle** when the mouse moves over it. We can do this using a flag variable.

```javascript
let isInside = false;       // This flag tracks if the mouse is over the circle
let selectedColour = "green";

function setup() {
  createCanvas(400, 400);
}

function draw() {
  background(220);

  fill(selectedColour);
  circle(300, 100, 100);

    // how do we check if we have collided?


}

function checkCollisions(x1, y1, x2, y2) {
  if (dist(x1, y1, x2, y2) < 50) {
    return true;  // collision happened
  } else {
    return false; // no collision
  }
}
```

### **How it works**

1. We create a **flag variable**: `isInside = false`.
2. Every frame, we **check if the mouse is over the circle**.
3. If it is, we **set the flag to true** and update the colour.
4. If not, we **set the flag to false** and restore the original colour.
5. The flag keeps track of **the “state”** of the circle, so we can react to changes in a controlled way.
