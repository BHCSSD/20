* `checkCollisions` shows up for the first time for hitboxes.

## Example 1: Returning a Random colour


Suppose we want a function `getRandomcolour()` that returns a colour chosen at random.


If this function existed, we could write:


```javascript
function mousePressed() {
 let col = getRandomcolour(); // Call function → store result in the variable col
 fill(col);
 stroke('black');
 circle(mouseX, mouseY, 30);
}
```


This would draw a circle each time the mouse is pressed, using a random colour each time.


But `getRandomcolour()` doesn’t exist yet… So let's make it




##  Writing `getRandomcolour()`


1. Step 1: Make a list of colours
    * We’ll create a **local array** that holds possible colour options.


2. Step 2: Pick a random colour


   * Use p5.js’s built-in `random()` function to choose one item from the list.


3. Step 3: Return the chosen colour


   * Use `return` to send that colour back to the code that called it.


```javascript
function getRandomcolour() {
 let colours = ['red', 'orange', 'yellow', 'green', 'blue']; // local list
  let colourChoice = random(colours); // local variable
  return colourChoice; // send result back to caller
}
```


Now `getRandomcolour()` returns a random colour **every time it’s called**.


> [!NOTE]
> ## INFODUMP:
>How `return` Works
>
> When JavaScript runs a function:
>
> 1. It executes each line of code *inside* the function.
> 2. When it hits a `return` statement, the function **stops immediately**.
> 3. The value after `return` is sent *back* to wherever the function was called.
>
> If no `return` is written, JavaScript automatically returns `undefined`.
>
> So this:
> ```javascript
> function add(a, b) {
>  let total = a + b;
>  return total;
> }
> ```
>
> is the same as:
>
> ```javascript
> let sum = add(3, 4); // sum now stores 7
> ```


### Checkpoint


What happens if we delete the last line `return colourChoice;`?


```javascript
function getRandomcolour() {
 let colours = ['red', 'orange', 'yellow', 'green', 'blue'];
 let colourChoice = random(colours);
 // return colourChoice;  <-- deleted
}
```






* [ ] The code runs the same, drawing circles in 5 different random colours.
* [ ] The code runs until a mouse press, then crashes.
* [ ] The code runs, but the random colour is always `undefined`, so each circle has no fill.
* [ ] The code will not run at all.

  C) The code runs, but the random colour is always `undefined`, so each circle has no fill.

## Why Helper Functions Help


We could have just written all the colour-picking logic directly inside `mousePressed()`.
But **helper functions** make your code better because they:


* Make code **cleaner** and more **readable**.
* Let you **reuse** logic in multiple places.
* Make programs **easier to update**: change one function, and all uses update automatically.

###  Checkpoint


Which of the following is **NOT** an advantage of using helper functions?


* [ ] Helper functions help your function names clearly describe what they do.
* [ ] Helper functions break your code into smaller, clearer pieces.
* [ ] Helper functions make your code run faster.
* [ ] Helper functions let you make changes in one place that apply everywhere.

## Multiple Returns in One Function


Sometimes a function may need **different return values** depending on the situation.


**HINT WE WILL USE THIS SOON:**


```javascript
function checkCollisions(x1, y1, x2, y2) {
 if (dist(x1, y1, x2, y2) < 50) {
   return true;  // collision happened
 } else {
   return false; // no collision
 }
}
```


**Note:**
Once JavaScript reaches a `return` statement, the function **stops running immediately**.
No code after that line will execute.


### TODO:
Copy the above code and lets see how it works
* This is very important Code for later.
