20.1.10 Assign: Trivia
```




This assignment is not about solving a hard problem. Instead, it is designed to get you to read existing code that uses functions and figure out how it works.
* In other words, it is about getting comfortable with functions that use parameters before you have to write them yourself.





> [!IMPORTANT]
> Load the code and We will fix the `keyPressed()` together to make it neater with functions.





---
## Part 1: Familiarize Yourself with the Code
- Read through the code carefully to see how it is structured.  Look carefully at how the question() and marking() functions are written.
- Test it by answering the first question in a variety of ways.  You will discover that the displayScore() function produces an error.


---
## Part 2: Improve the displayScore Function (10%)
- The line text("Current score: " + badvariable, 50, 360); needs to be fixed.  Change it so that it prints the sc variable. 
- Remember that sc is the local variable that stores the score -inside the displayScore function. 


- Alter or add textSize() lines so that the 'Correct' message is printed in large text and the score is printed in somewhat smaller text.


---
## Part 3: Change the Theme
- Change the first question to be about a movie/game or some other trivia topic.
- **Optional:** Add text or a ZERO scene that introduces the trivia game.


---
## Part 4: Adding the Other Questions
For the rest of this assignment, you are making new functions and calling them in the keyPressed() function.


- Add 4 additional questions by adding to the keyPressed() function. Each is worth 20%:
- Base each on the code exactly as written for question 1.
- Each question should have 3 marking levels (IF… ELSE IF… ELSE)
   - For the Partially Correct IF statement code, you must use a few different String Functions for full marks (see final 20%)


---
## Clean Code:
You will be marked on your code formating. Make sure it is clean


## Final 20%
- Within your IF statements, you must use all of the following String functions:
 - `.includes`
 - `.startsWith`
 - `.endsWith`
 - `.charAt`
   - https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_obj_string.asp.


Remember that we used all of these in our Band Name Analyzer example.
5% for each.


---
## Hint
- Remember your `if()` statements can have  or `||`
- `.toLower()` will do just that. Can help reduce user error.

            score += 1;
