20.3.03 Assign: Mad Libs
```

## Objective

You will create a **Mad Libs app** that:
1. Lets a user upload a `.txt` story that contains **smart words** like `<noun>`, `<verb>`, `<adjective>`.
2. Displays the uploaded story on screen.
3. Replaces those smart words with the user’s custom inputs.
4. Displays the **new, completed story** on screen.

## Step 1: Example Mad Libs Template

Create a text file `madlib.txt` with placeholder “smart words.”  
These should be surrounded by angle brackets `< >`. 
* Why you may ask? Easy standardization for me.


**Example `madlib.txt`:**
```

Once upon a time, there was a <noun> who loved to <verb> every single day.
One morning, the <noun> found a <adjective> treasure in the backyard!

```
Add an upload button to load you madlib.txt.

## Step 2: Create Textboxes for User Input

Each textbox will collect one type of word: noun, verb, adjective, etc.  
We’ll store each textbox’s value in a variable so it can be used later.

---

## Step 3: Replace the Smart Words

Now that the text is loaded and user inputs are stored,  use `.replace()`
to swap every `<noun>`, `<verb>`, and `<adjective>` etc with the user’s chosen words.

* Make sure to replace *all* occurrences of the smart word.

---

## Step 4: Display text and Save button
 * Make a save button to allow users to download their story
 * Display the story on the canvas
