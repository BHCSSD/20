20.3.05 Lesson: Intro to JSON
```


## 1. What Is JSON?


**JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)** is a **lightweight, text-based format** used to represent structured data.
It’s one of the most common ways for web applications to **send and receive data** between clients and servers.


* It provides a way to **structure and exchange data** between applications.
* JSON supports **objects** and **arrays**, and works across many languages, not just JavaScript.
* JSON files use the `.json` extension

> [!TIP]
> In p5.js you’ll often use JSON files to store settings, level data, sprites, or game states.

## 2. Key Features of JSON


1. **Human-readable**: Easy to write and understand.
2. **Compact format**: Lightweight and efficient for transferring data.
3. **Cross-platform support**: Works with nearly all programming languages and systems.
4. **Flexible data types**: Supports strings, numbers, arrays, objects, booleans, and null values.
5. **Text-based**: Easy to transmit through networks like HTTP.

## 3. JSON Syntax and Structure

A JSON **object** is a collection of key-value pairs:
```json
{
 "name": "John Doe",
 "age": 30,
 "isStudent": false
}
```
Each **key** is a string, and each **value** can be a string, number, array, object, boolean, or null.
* notice that each line is separated by a comma `,`
* You can put an **array** as one of the values:
  ```json
  {
    "fruits": ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
  }
  ```

 * `fruits[0]` would be apple
 * `fruits[2]` would be cherry

## 4. Example: JSON with Nested Objects and Arrays


* Arrays can hold **multiple data types**, including other objects.
 * objects inside of arrays inside of objects all the way down
  ```json
  {
   "Courses": [
     {
       "Name": "Java Foundation",
       "Created by": "GeeksforGeeks",
       "Content": ["Java Core", "JSP", "Servlets", "Collections"]
     },
     {
       "Name": "Data Structures",
       "Also known as": "Interview Preparation Course",
       "Topics": ["Trees", "Graphs", "Maps"]
     }
   ]
  }
  ```
* `course[0].Name` would give you Java Foundation
* `course[0].Created by` would give you who I stole this from
* `course[0].Content[1]` would give you JSP

## 6. JSON vs JavaScript Objects


At first glance, **JSON** looks almost identical to a **JavaScript object**, like this:


```javascript
let foo = {
 name: "John",
 age: 30
};
```


But there are **key differences** between the two:


| Feature       | JSON                                  |                  
| ------------- | ------------------------------------- | 
| **Quotes**    | Keys **must** use double quotes `" "` | 
| **Functions** |  Not allowed                         |  
| **Comments**  |  Not allowed                         | 
| **Usage**     | Used for data exchange and storage    | 


JSON is especially useful when loading or saving data from a file or a web server.
