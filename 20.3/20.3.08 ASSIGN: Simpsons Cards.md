## **Step 1: Load JSON From the API**

Use this API endpoint:

```
https://thesimpsonsapi.com/api/characters
```

You should load the data using an **async function** and `loadJSON()`.

* Don’t call `loadJSON()` directly inside `draw()`  it will spam the API.
* Make a variable like `simpsonsData` at the top so you can check if it’s loaded.
* Use `console.log()` to inspect what the API actually gives you.

---

## **Step 2: Store and Prepare Your Data**

After loading:

* Save the API response to a variable
* Make sure the data exists before you draw cards
* (Optional but recommended) Write a helper like `formatQuote(quote)` to trim overly long quotes

> [!TIP]
> * Some quotes can be *really* long. Students often stretch the card offscreen keep that quote under control.
> * Check for missing fields. APIs sometimes send `undefined`.

---

## **Step 3: Draw Your Playing Cards**

Each card must include:

* A **background rectangle**
* The **character image**
* The **name**
* A **quote** (wrapped or shortened)

Use a helper function:

```
createCard(character, x, y)
```

Use a **loop** to draw all 5 cards.

> [!TIP]
> If your image isn't showing up, look for:
>
> * Using `image()` before it finishes loading
> * Wrong property names from the API
> * Missing width/height values

---

## **Step 4: Use Functions for Modularity**

Your sketch must use **multiple helper functions**, such as:

* `loadSimpsonsData()`
* `drawAllCards()`
* `createCard()`
* `formatQuote()`

Avoid dumping everything inside `draw()`  clean structure will *save you* later.

> [!TIP]
> Functions = less chaos. If a card looks wrong, you debug in one place instead of hunting through the entire sketch.

---

## **Step 5: Arrange the Cards on the Screen**

Place your 5 cards in either:

* A **single row**, or
* A **2x3 grid** (one empty spot)

Cards must be:

* Evenly spaced
* Clear and readable
* Not overlapping text or images

**Layout advice:**

* Work with variables like `cardW`, `cardH`, and `padding` instead of magic numbers.
* Do the layout first with placeholder rectangles, then add images and text.

---

## **Step 6: Higher Level Extensions**

1. Add a **hover effect**
   (e.g., card enlarges slightly or has a glowing border).

2. Add a **filter feature**:

   * Press **H** → show *only* main family members
   * Press **A** → show all 5 cards again

3. Add a **Randomize button**

   * Fetch new characters from the API
   * Redraw the cards with the new data

> [!TIP]
>If you implement filtering or randomizing, separate your “original” and “displayed” data so you don’t lose the full set.

---

## **Optional Style Upgrades**

Try giving the cards a theme:

* TV trading card borders
* A holographic foil shimmer
* Color coding (funny, angry, calm, etc.)
* Shadowed borders or rounded corners
