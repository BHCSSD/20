20.4.05 Lesson: Division and Local Variables
```

**Things to focus on:**
* style guide
* the 3 types of division

## The Style Guide

A **style guide** is a set of rules that programmers follow to make code **clear, consistent, and easy to read**.

It helps everyone on a team understand each other’s code, just like grammar rules help everyone understand writing.

```python
def calculate_area(radius):
    area = 3.14 * radius ** 2
    return area
```

### Python Style Tips

* **Function names** → use `snake_case` (`calculate_area`, `add_numbers`)
* **Local variables** → create them *inside* functions
* **Each function should have one clear job**

## Checkpoint: 

1. What’s a Local Variable?
    <details>
      <summary>ANSWER</summary>
      
      A **local variable** is a variable that lives *inside a function*.
    It only exists while the function is running.
    ```python
    def add(a, b):
        result = a + b    # result is local to this function
        return result
    ```

    If you try to print `result` outside the function, it won’t work, it’s gone from memory once the function ends.

### p5.js vs Python

| Concept          | Python                  | p5.js                               |
| ---------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Function keyword | `def`                   | `function`                          |
| Local variable   | Declared inside a `def` | Declared inside a `function`        |
| Return value     | `return value`          | `return value;`                     |
| Naming style     | `snake_case`            | `camelCase` (e.g., `calculateArea`) |


```python
# Python
def add(a, b):
    result = a + b #evverything inside the function is 1 tab in
    return result
```

```javascript
// p5.js
function add(a, b) {
  let result = a + b;
  return result;
}
```

## **Three types of Division you need to know**

Division is one of those things that *looks simple*, but programming languages give you a few different versions, each with slightly different behavior.


### 1. `/`: **Regular Division**

```python
print(5 / 2)   # 2.5
print(8 / 4)   # 2.0
```

**What it does:**

* Always returns a **float** (a number with a decimal point), even if the division is exact.
* `8 / 4` gives `2.0`, **not** `2`.
* Useful when you need precise fractional values.

 **When to use:**
When you want the *exact* result of dividing two numbers, including any decimal.

---

### 2. `//`: **Floor Division** aka DIV
**This Works only in Python:**

```python
print(5 // 2)   # 2
print(8 // 4)   # 2
print(-5 // 2)  # -3  (rounds DOWN!)
```

**What it does:**

* Divides one number by another but **truncates (cuts off)** the decimal part.
* It **rounds down** to the nearest whole number: not just “drops” the decimal.
* This means negative results behave differently than you might expect:

  * `-5 // 2` gives `-3`, because -2.5 rounds down to -3.

**In p5.js:**
There is **no built-in `//` operator**.
If you want the same behavior, use:

```javascript
Math.floor(5 / 2);  // 2
Math.floor(-5 / 2); // -3
```
 **When to use:**
When you only want the *whole number* result of a division (like dividing cookies evenly among friends).

---

### 3. `%`: **Modulus / Remainder Operator** aka MOD

```python
print(5 % 2)   # 1
print(9 % 3)   # 0
print(14 % 5)  # 4
```

**What it does:**

* Returns **what’s left over** after dividing one number by another.
* `5 % 2` → 5 ÷ 2 = 2 remainder **1**
* `9 % 3` → 9 ÷ 3 = 3 remainder **0**

 **When to use:**
When you need to check if something divides evenly (`num % 3 == 0`),
**or** to repeat patterns (like moving sprites every 5 frames).

---

### **TL;DR**

| Operation        | Symbol | Example (5 ÷ 2) | Result | Type Returned   |
| ---------------- | ------ | --------------- | ------ | --------------- | 
| Regular Division | `/`    | `5 / 2`         | `2.5`  | Float / Decimal | 
| Floor Division   | `//`   | `5 // 2`        | `2`    | Integer         | 
| Modulus          | `%`    | `5 % 2`         | `1`    | Integer         | 


* Use `/` when you want **decimal precision**.
* Use `//` when you only want **whole numbers** (and don’t care about the remainder).
* Use `%` when you need **the remainder** or to check for **multiples** (divisibility).



Here’s a set of **6 checkpoint questions** for practicing `/`, `//`, and `%` in Python:

---

## Checkpoint

1. **Division**

```python
result = 15 / 4
print(result)
```

---

2. **DIV**

```python
result = 15 // 4
print(result)
```

* What does `//` do differently from `/`?

---

3. **Modulus Operator**

```python
remainder = 15 % 4
print(remainder)
```

---

4. **Modulus Operator**

```python
number = 27
if number % 2 == 0:
    print("A")
else:
    print("Q")
```

---

5. **Combined DIV and Mod**

```python
total_items = 23
items_per_box = 5

full_boxes = total_items // items_per_box
leftover_items = total_items % items_per_box

print(full_boxes, leftover_items)
```

* Predict the output.

---

6. **Cycling Through a List**

```python
# Use modulus to cycle through a list
colors = ["red", "green", "blue"]
index = 0

index = (index + 1) % len(colors)
print(colors[index])
```

* What color will print? What happens if this line runs 5 times?
