> * You can put **if statements inside loops** to check conditions while repeating code.
> * This is useful for filtering data, finding specific items, or stopping a loop when something happens.

## **Python Loops Style Guide**


When writing loops in Python, follow these guidelines to make your code **readable, maintainable, and correct**.






### **1. Use Descriptive Function and Variable Names**


* Always name your function and variables in a way that describes their purpose.
* Avoid vague names like `x` or `arr1` unless in very small loops for temporary values.


   ```python
   numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]


   def total(numbers_list):  # descriptive function name
      sum_total = 0  # local variable to store the sum


      for num in numbers_list:
          sum_total += num  # add each number to the total
      return sum_total


   print(total(numbers))
   ```




### **2. Use a Local Variable for Accumulators**


* When summing or collecting items, create a **local variable** to store the result.
* Never reuse unrelated variables for accumulation.


   ```python
   def total(numbers_list):
      total_sum = 0  # local accumulator


      for num in numbers_list:
          total_sum += num
      return total_sum
   ```

### **3. Keep Loops Readable**
* Indent properly (Python requires it).
* Keep your loop body concise and focused on one task.






### **4. Non-Mutating Loops**


* If creating a new list based on a sequence, **do not modify the original list**.
* Make a new list and append items to the new list based on your conditions.




   ```python
   # (filtering even numbers):
   numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5,7,8,9,3,4,5,6,1010101010000101010]


   def all_evens(numbers_list):
      evens = []  # new list to store even numbers
     
      for num in numbers_list:
          if num % 2 == 0:  # check if divisible by 2
              evens.append(num)  # add to new list
      return evens


   print(all_evens(numbers)) 
   ```




### **5. Use Comments Wisely**


* Comment **why** something is happening, not just **what** (Python code often already shows what is happening).
* Avoid over-commenting every line, focus on tricky logic or important details like modulo checks or accumulators.




### **6. Combine Loops and Conditionals Clearly**


* If using `if` statements inside loops, indent properly and use clear conditions.
* Each loop should perform a single, clear task.




   ```python
   def positive_numbers(numbers_list):
      positives = []
      for num in numbers_list:
          if num > 0:
              positives.append(num)
      return positives
   ```






### **7. Keep Code Modular**


* If you find yourself copying and pasting code spin it off into it own **function**.
* Loops should generally be inside a function rather than floating in global scope.

# **TODO**


* Write a function for each question using a `for` or `while` loop.
* Use **local variables** to accumulate results or build new lists.
   * you will be deducted marks if you do not
* For Exercise 9, write a single function that calls all the previous test functions.






1. **Sum of Numbers**


Write a function named `sum_of_numbers` that takes a list of numbers and returns the sum of all numbers.


```python
# Test Function
def test_sum_of_numbers():
   assert sum_of_numbers([1, 2, 3, 4]) == 10
   assert sum_of_numbers([10, 20, 30]) == 60
   assert sum_of_numbers([5, 7, 2]) == 14
   print("Exercise 1 is correct.")
```


---


2. **Largest Number**


Write a function named `largest_number` that takes a list of numbers and returns the largest number.
* You **must** use a local variable and an `if` statement.


   ```python
   # Test Function
   def test_largest_number():
      assert largest_number([1, 2, 3, 4]) == 4
      assert largest_number([10, 20, 30]) == 30
      assert largest_number([5, 7, 2]) == 7
      print("Exercise 2 is correct.")
   ```


---


3. **Reverse a List**


Write a function named `reverse_list` that takes a list and returns a **new list** with elements in reverse order.
* *hint* line 1 of your function should be an empty list you append new values to.


```python
# Test Function
def test_reverse_list():
   assert reverse_list([1, 2, 3, 4]) == [4, 3, 2, 1]
   assert reverse_list([10, 20, 30]) == [30, 20, 10]
   assert reverse_list([5, 7, 2]) == [2, 7, 5]
   print("Exercise 3 is correct.")
```


---


4. **Product of Numbers**


Write a function named `product_of_numbers` that takes a list of numbers and returns the product of all numbers.
* (product is the mathy word for multiply)


   ```python
   # Test Function
   def test_product_of_numbers():
      assert product_of_numbers([1, 2, 3, 4]) == 24
      assert product_of_numbers([10, 2, 3]) == 60
      assert product_of_numbers([5, 7, 2]) == 70
      print("Exercise 4 is correct.")
   ```


---


5. **Even Numbers**


Write a function named `even_numbers` that takes a list of numbers and returns a **new list** containing only the even numbers.
* *hint*... see the hint from #3... hint hint


   ```python
   # Test Function
   def test_even_numbers():
      assert even_numbers([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == [2, 4]
      assert even_numbers([10, 20, 30, 1]) == [10, 20, 30]
      assert even_numbers([5, 7, 2, 6]) == [2, 6]
      print("Exercise 5 is correct.")
   ```

* *hint*... see the hint from #5... hint hint hint


   ```python
   # Test Function
   def test_odd_numbers():
      assert odd_numbers([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == [1, 3, 5]
      assert odd_numbers([10, 20, 30, 1]) == [1]
      assert odd_numbers([5, 7, 2, 6]) == [5, 7]
      print("Exercise 6 is correct.")
   ```


---


7. **Squares of Numbers**


Write a function named `squares_of_numbers` that takes a list of numbers and returns a **new list** containing the squares of each number.
* *hint*... see the hint from #6... hint hint hint hint


   ```python
   # Test Function
   def test_squares_of_numbers():
      assert squares_of_numbers([1, 2, 3, 4]) == [1, 4, 9, 16]
      assert squares_of_numbers([10, 20, 30]) == [100, 400, 900]
      assert squares_of_numbers([5, 7, 2]) == [25, 49, 4]
      print("Exercise 7 is correct.")
   ```


---


8. **Average of Numbers**


Write a function named `average_of_numbers` that takes a list of numbers and returns the **average (mean)** value.


* *hint*: Use a local variable to sum all the numbers first, then divide by the length of the list.


   ```python
   # Test Function
   def test_average_of_numbers():
      assert average_of_numbers([1, 2, 3, 4]) == 2.5
