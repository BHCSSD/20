20.4.06 Assign: Division and Local Variables
```


## **TODO**

1. **Absolute Value**
   * Write a function named `absoluteValue` that takes in a number and returns the absolute value of that number.
   *Hint:* Absolute value is the positive value of any number.
   *Hint Hint:* Python has a built-in function that can do this... look it up but you are not allowed to use it

2. **Multiple of Three**
   * Write a function named `multipleThree` that takes in a number and returns `True` if the number is evenly divisible by 3, otherwise `False`.
   *Hint:* Use the modulus operator `%`.

3. **Multiple of Five**
   * Write a function named `multipleFive` that takes in a number and returns `True` if the number is evenly divisible by 5, otherwise `False`.

4. **Multiple of Both Three and Five**
   * Write a function named `testThreeAndFive` that takes in a number and returns `True` if it’s evenly divisible by both 3 and 5, otherwise `False`.

5. **Square a Number**
   * Write a function named `square` that takes in a number and returns the number multiplied by itself.
   * you are **NOT** allowed to do `num*num` there is a better way
        * Check [W3Schools Operators](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_operators.asp) for help.

6. **Add Two Numbers**
   * Write a function named `add` that takes in two numbers and returns their sum.
    Use a local variable to store the sum before returning it.

7. **Cube a Number**
   * Write a function named `cube` that takes in a number and returns that number multiplied by itself twice.
   * you are **NOT** allowed to do `num*num` there is a better way
    * Use a local variable before returning the result.
        * Check [W3Schools Operators](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_operators.asp) for help.

8. **Square Root**
   * Write a function named `squareRoot` that takes in a number and returns its square root.
   You can use the power operator `**` with `0.5` instead of importing `math`.

9. **Subtract Two Numbers**
   * Write a function named `subtract` that takes in two numbers and returns the first minus the second.
   * Use a local variable before returning the result.

10. **Multiply Two Numbers**
    * Write a function named `multiply` that takes in two numbers and returns their product.
    * Use a local variable before returning the result.

11. **Divide Two Numbers (No Remainder)**
    * Write a function named `divide` that takes in two numbers and returns the first divided by the second **without any remainder**.
    * Use a local variable before returning the result.


12. **Find the Remainder**
    * Write a function named `remainder` that takes in two numbers and returns the remainder after dividing the first by the second.
    *Hint:* Use the modulus operator `%`.

13. **Sum of Squares**
    * Write a function named `sumOfSquares` that takes in two numbers, squares each one, and returns the sum of both squares. You must use local variables
