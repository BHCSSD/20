20.4.01 Lesson: Variables and Lists
```


**Things to focus on:**


* Create and use **variables** to store data.
* Work with **booleans** to represent truth values.
* Create and modify **lists** in Python.
* Use built-in **list methods** like `append()`, `remove()`, and `sort()`.
* Combine lists 2 lists together using `+` and `extend()`.

## **Part 1: Variables**
> [!NOTE]
> ## INFODUMP:
>
> In p5js we made a **variable** by using the keyword `let` in python is made by using the **assignment operator** `=` to give a value to a variable.
>
> ```python
> name = "James Bond"
> age = 36
> pi = 3.14
> ```
> no need for the word `let`.  just `x=5` etc



## **Part 2: Booleans**
> [!NOTE]
> ## INFODUMP:
>
> Booleans represent two possible states:
>
> * `True`
> * `False`
>
> They are often used in logic or comparisons.
>
> ```python
> is_hungry = True
> is_raining = False
> ```
> **Remember:** Use capital `T` and `F`. Python uses uppercase `T/F` p5js uses lowercase `t`/`f`



### **Checkpoint:**


1. Which of these is **valid** Python code?


   * [ ] `is_hungry = true`
   * [ ] `is_hungry = "True"`
   * [ ] `is_hungry = True`
   * [ ] `is_hungry = FALSE`




     <details>
       <summary>ANSWER</summary>


       C. `is_hungry = True`
     </details>

## **Part 3: Lists**
> [!NOTE]
> ## INFODUMP:
>
> A **list** is a collection of items (numbers, strings, etc.) stored in one variable. As with variables we do not need the keyword `let` just use the **assignment operator**  `=`
>
> ```python
> fruits = ["mango", "banana", "guava"]
> numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
> ```
>
> Lists are:
>
> * **Ordered** → items keep their position, unless we program it, the list will keep its order
> * **Indexed** → each item has a number starting from **0**
> * **Mutable** → this means you can change them what is inside of lists
>   * **Strings** are immutable... you cant change them directly   



### **Checkpoint:**




```python
fruits = ["mango", "banana", "guava"]
```
2. What is the **index** of `"banana"` in this list?
   * [ ] 0
   * [ ] 1
   * [ ] 2
   * [ ] 3
     <details>
       <summary>ANSWER</summary>
       B. 1
     </details>

## **Part 4: Common List Methods**


Python has built-in list methods that make it easy to add, remove, and sort data.


| Method      | What It Does                 | Example                     |
| ----------- | ---------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| `append()`  | Adds an item to the end      | `fruits.append("kiwi")`     |
| `remove()`  | Removes a specific item      | `fruits.remove("banana")`   |
| `sort()`    | Sorts alphabetically (A → Z) | `fruits.sort()`             |
| `reverse()` | Reverses the list            | `numbers.reverse()`         |
| `extend()`  | Combines two lists           | `fruits.extend(vegetables)` |


---


### **Checkpoint:**


```python
pets = ["dog", "cat"]
pets.append("hamster")
```
3. What does this code do?




   * [ ] Removes `"cat"`
   * [ ] Adds `"hamster"` to the end of the list
   * [ ] Sorts the list alphabetically
   * [ ] Creates a new list
     <details>
       <summary>ANSWER</summary>
       B. Adds `"hamster"` to the end of the list
     </details>

## **Part 5: Combining Lists**


You can **join** two lists together in two ways:


### Method 1: Using `+`
to make a fully new list use the `+`. This is called **nonmutating**
* `newList` = `listA` **+** `listB`
   ```python
   fruits_and_veggies = fruits + vegetables
   ```


### Method 2: Using `extend()`
To **mutate** the original list  uses `extend()`. This changes the original list.


 ```python
 fruits.extend(vegetables)
 ```


The `extend` method **modifies** the original list instead of creating a new one `+`. Pay attention to which one you need to use in which situation.


---


### **Checkpoint:**


4. What is the main difference between `+` and `extend()`?


   * [ ] `+` creates a new list, `extend()` changes the existing one.
   * [ ] `extend()` deletes both lists.
   * [ ] `+` only works with strings.
   * [ ] They are identical in every way.
     <details>
       <summary>ANSWER</summary>


       A. `+` creates a new list, `extend()` changes the existing one.
     </details>

## **Part 6: Understanding Assertions**


An **assertion** is a simple built-in test in Python.
It helps check if your code is working correctly.


```python
x = 5
assert x == 5, "x should equal 5"
print("Assertion passed!")
```


If the condition is false, Python stops and shows an `AssertionError`.


---


### **Checkpoint:**


5. What happens if the `assert` condition is **False**?


   * [ ] The code runs normally.
   * [ ] Python skips the line.
   * [ ] The program stops and shows an AssertionError.
   * [ ] It prints a warning only.


     <details>
       <summary>ANSWER</summary>
       C. The program stops and shows an AssertionError.
     </details>
