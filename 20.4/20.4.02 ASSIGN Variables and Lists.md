20.4.02 ASSIGN Variables and Lists
```

## **Overview**

In this assignment, you’ll practice **variables**, **booleans**, and **list operations** in Python.
Each exercise helps you build essential programming habits like defining variables, modifying data, and using built-in Python methods.

---

### **TODO**

1. Open **[VS Code Edu](https://vscodeedu.com/)** and create a **new Python file**.
2. Complete **each exercise** by writing the required Python code.
3. **Run** your file after each exercise to check your work.
4. If your code is correct, you’ll see messages like `Exercise 3 is correct`.
5. If something goes wrong, an **AssertionError** or **NameError** will help identify where to fix it.

> [!TIP]
> ## **How Assertions Work**
> 
> An **assertion** is a built-in Python test that checks if a condition is true.
> If the condition is false, the program will stop and show an error message, this helps identify mistakes quickly.
> 
> Example:
> 
> ```python
> x = 5
> assert x == 5, "x should equal 5"
> print("Assertion passed!")
> ```
> 
> If `x` were not 5, you’d see:
> `AssertionError: x should equal 5`


## **Quick Reference Guide for this assignment**

### **1. Variables**

A **variable** stores information.
Use `=` to assign a value.

```python
name = "James Bond"
age = 36
pi = 3.14
```

Variables can hold strings, numbers, lists, or even entire objects.

---

### **2. Boolean Values**

Booleans represent **True** or **False** values.
They are used in conditions and comparisons.

```python
is_sunny = True
has_homework = False
```

Remember: Use **capital T and F**. Python is case-sensitive.

---

### **3. Lists**

A **list** stores multiple items in one variable.

```python
fruits = ["mango", "banana", "guava"]
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

Lists are 
* **ordered** (items stay in order)
* **mutable** (you can change them), 
* **indexed** (first item is index 0).

---

### **4. Common List Methods**

Here are some of the most useful list operations:

| Method      | Description                         | Example                     |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| `append()`  | Adds an item to the end             | `fruits.append("kiwi")`     |
| `remove()`  | Removes a specific item             | `fruits.remove("banana")`   |
| `sort()`    | Sorts the list alphabetically (A–Z) | `fruits.sort()`             |
| `reverse()` | Reverses the order of the list      | `numbers.reverse()`         |
| `extend()`  | Combines lists                      | `fruits.extend(vegetables)` |

---

### **5. Combining Lists**

You can join two lists using either the `+` operator or `extend()`.

```python
fruits = ["mango", "banana", "guava"]
vegetables = ["carrot", "broccoli"]

# Method 1: Using +
fruits_and_veggies = fruits + vegetables

# Method 2: Using extend()
fruits.extend(vegetables)
```

---

## **Exercises TODO**

### **Exercise 0**

Uncomment the variable inside the function and run it.

```python
def exercise_0():
    # Uncomment the line below
    # doing_python_right_now = True

    assert doing_python_right_now == True, "If you see a NameError, it means the variable is not created. An AssertionError means the value is incorrect."
    print("Exercise 0 is correct")

exercise_0()
```

---

### **Exercise 1**

Create a variable named `on_mars_right_now` and assign it the boolean value `False`.

```python
def exercise_1():
    # Your code here
    
    assert on_mars_right_now == False, "If you see a NameError, be sure to create the variable and assign it a value."
    print("Exercise 1 is correct.")

exercise_1()
```

---

### **Exercise 2**

Create a global list (first lines no inside a function) variable named `fruits` that includes the following:
`"mango"`, `"banana"`, `"guava"`, `"kiwi"`, `"strawberry"`

```python
def exercise_2():
    # Your code here
    
    assert fruits == ["mango", "banana", "guava", "kiwi", "strawberry"], "Ensure the variable contains all the strings in the provided order."
    print("Exercise 2 is correct.")

exercise_2()
```

---

### **Exercise 3**

Create a list variable named `vegetables` that includes:
`"eggplant"`, `"broccoli"`, `"carrot"`, `"cauliflower"`, `"zucchini"`

```python
def exercise_3():
    # Your code here
    
    assert vegetables == ["eggplant", "broccoli", "carrot", "cauliflower", "zucchini"], "Ensure the variable contains all the strings in the provided order."
    print("Exercise 3 is correct.")

exercise_3()
```

---

### **Exercise 4**

Create a list named `numbers` that contains the numbers 1 through 10 in order.

```python
def exercise_4():
    # Your code here
    
    assert numbers == [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10], "Ensure the variable contains the numbers 1–10 in order."
    print("Exercise 4 is correct.")

exercise_4()
```

---

## **List Operations**

### **Exercise 5**

Using `.append()`, add `"tomato"` to the end of the list `fruits`.
Do **not** hard-code `"tomato"` directly into the list.

```python
def exercise_5():
    # Your code here

    assert fruits == ["mango", "banana", "guava", "kiwi", "strawberry", "tomato"], "Ensure the variable contains all the strings in the right order."
    print("Exercise 5 is correct.")

exercise_5()
```

---

### **Exercise 6**

Using `.remove()`, delete `"tomato"` from the list `vegetables`.
Do **not** modify the list manuallyuse code to remove it.

```python
def exercise_6():
    vegetables = ["eggplant", "tomato", "broccoli", "carrot", "cauliflower", "zucchini"]
    # Your code here

    assert vegetables == ["eggplant", "broccoli", "carrot", "cauliflower", "zucchini"], "Ensure the variable contains all the strings in the provided order."
    print("Exercise 6 is correct.")

exercise_6()
```

---

### **Exercise 7**

Reverse the list `numbers`.
Hint: Check out the `.reverse()` method or the `[::-1]` slicing trick on W3Schools.

```python
def exercise_7():
    numbers = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
    # Your code here

    assert numbers == [10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1], "Assert Error means that the answer is incorrect."
    print("Exercise 7 is correct.")

exercise_7()
```

---

### **Exercise 8**

Sort `vegetables` in **alphabetical order**.

```python
def exercise_8():
    vegetables = ["eggplant", "broccoli", "carrot", "cauliflower", "zucchini", "tomato"]
    # Your code here

    assert vegetables == ["broccoli", "carrot", "cauliflower", "eggplant", "tomato", "zucchini"], "Ensure vegetables are sorted alphabetically."
    print("Exercise 8 is correct.")

exercise_8()
```

---

### **Exercise 9**

Sort `fruits` in **reverse alphabetical order**.

```python
def exercise_9():
    fruits = ["mango", "banana", "guava", "kiwi", "strawberry", "tomato"]
    # Your code here

    assert fruits == ["tomato", "strawberry", "mango", "kiwi", "guava", "banana"], "Ensure fruits are sorted in reverse alphabetical order."
    print("Exercise 9 is correct.")

exercise_9()
```

---

### **Exercise 10**

Create a single list named `fruits_and_veggies` that contains all `fruits` followed by all `vegetables`.

```python
def exercise_10():
    fruits = ["tomato", "strawberry", "mango", "kiwi", "guava", "banana"]
    vegetables = ["broccoli", "carrot", "cauliflower", "eggplant", "tomato", "zucchini"]
    # Your code here

    assert fruits_and_veggies == ["tomato", "strawberry", "mango", "kiwi", "guava", "banana", "broccoli", "carrot", "cauliflower", "eggplant", "tomato", "zucchini"], "Ensure the final list combines all fruits and vegetables."
    print("Exercise 10 is correct.")

exercise_10()
```
