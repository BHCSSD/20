20.4.09 LESSON Loops and Conditions
```
**Things to focus on:**
* Write and understand **if**, **for**, and **while** loops
* Combine loops and conditionals effectively
* Use **local variables** to store intermediate results
* Build functions that process and transform lists
---

## **1. If Statements**
> [!NOTE]
> ### Infodump: What’s an If Statement?
>
> An **if statement** lets your program make decisions.
> It checks a **condition** (True/False) and only runs code when the condition is true.
>
> ```python
> x = 10
> if x > 5:
>    print("x is bigger than 5")
> elif x == 5:
>    print("x is exactly 5")
> else:
>    print("x is smaller than 5")
> ```

### Checkpoint
What will this code print?

```python
def check_temperature(temp):
   if temp > 100:
       return "Boil"
   elif temp >= 50:
       return "Warmish"
   else:
       return "Cold"


```


```python
print( check_temperature(120) )
print( check_temperature(100) )   
print( check_temperature(75)  )
print( check_temperature(50)  ) 
print( check_temperature(40)  )
```

## **2. For Loops**
> [!NOTE]
> ## INFODUMP:
>
> A **for loop** repeats code once for each item in a sequence (like a list or string).
>
> ```python
> fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
> for fruit in fruits:
>    print("I like", fruit)
> ```
>  The loop reads each element (`fruit`) from the list and runs the code inside the block for each one.


### HowTo: Loop Over a List


1. Start with `for varName in list:`
   * `for num in numbers:`
   * `for fruit in fruits:`
   * `for card in deck:`
   * `for note in melody:`
   * `for thing in array:`
2. Inside the loop, write what you want to do with each item.
3. Indent your code properly, Python requires this

   ```python
   for num in [1, 2, 3]:
      print(num * 2)
   ```


   Output:

   ```
   2
   4
   6
   ```

### Common things to do in a Loop
1. **Looping through numbers**


   ```python
   def print_numbers(nums):
      for num in nums:
          print(num)


   print_numbers([-10,108, 133])
   ```

2. **Looping through a string**


   ```python
   def print_letters(word):
      for char in word:
          print(char)




   print_letters("python")
   ```

3. **Looping through every item in a List**


   ```python
   def print_fruits(fruits):
      for fruit in fruits:
          print(fruit)




   print_fruits(["apple", "banana", "cherry"])
   ```
5. **Looping and doing math**


   ```python
   def double_numbers(nums):
      for item in nums:
          return(item * 2)




   print(double_numbers([10, 20, 30]))
   ```
---


## **3. While Loops**
> [!NOTE]
> ## INFODUMP:
>
> A **while loop** repeats **as long as** a condition is true.
>
> ```python
> count = 0  #make a counter
> while count < 5:  # COndition: a True false question
>    print("Count is", count)
>    count += 1  #increment counter
> ```

### HowTo: Control a While Loop


1. Write your condition carefully.
2. Use a **counter variable** to track progress.
3. Update it (`count += 1`) inside the loop.


**Key ideas:**


* Must include something inside the loop that changes the condition.
* Otherwise, it becomes an **infinite loop** (it never ends)

## Checkpoint

1. **Counting Up**
   * Write a `while` loop that prints numbers from 1 to 5.
       <details>
       <summary>ANSWER</summary>
      
       ```python
       def count_up():
          counter = 1          # start at 1
          while counter <= 5:  # loop until counter is 5
              print(counter)
              counter += 1     # increment counter

       count_up()# Call the function
       ```
       </details>

2. **Countdown**


   * Write a `while` loop that prints numbers from 10 down to 1, then `"Blast off!"`.
       <details>
       <summary>ANSWER</summary>


       ```python
       def countdown():
          counter = 10
          while counter >= 1:
              print(counter)
              counter -= 1     # decrement counter
          print("Blast off!")




       countdown()# Call the function
       ```
       </details>


3. **Sum Until Limit**


   * Write a `while` loop that adds numbers starting from 1 until the sum is greater than 20. Print sums after each step. 
       * Start with local variables  `total=0`, `current=1` add them together until the number is bigger than 20.


       <details>
       <summary>ANSWER</summary>
      
       ```python
       def sum_until_limit():
          total = 0
          current = 1
          while total <= 20:
              total += current
              print(total)
              current += 1


       sum_until_limit() # Call the function
       ```
       </details>


4. **Find First Multiple of 7 Greater Than 50**
   * hint you need mod `%`, along with the `!=`
       <details>
       <summary>ANSWER</summary>
      
       ```python
       def first_multiple_of_7_over_50():
          num = 51  # start at 51 because we want > 50
          while num % 7 != 0:  # loop until divisible by 7
              num += 1
          print(num)




       first_multiple_of_7_over_50()# Call the function
       ```
       </details>

## **4. Combining If Statements and Loops**


You can put **if statements inside loops** to check conditions as the loop runs.


```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
for num in numbers:
   if num % 2 == 0:
       print(num, "is even")
   else:
       print(num, "is odd")
```


> [!NOTE]
> ## INFODUMP:
> The Modulus Operator `%`
>
> `%` gives you the **remainder** when dividing two numbers.
>  You can use it to check is a number is fully divisible by something
>
>
> ```python
> print(7 % 2)  # 1 → 7 divided by 2 = remainder 1 → odd
> print(8 % 2)  # 0 → 8 divided by 2 = remainder 0 → even
> print(15 % 3) # 0 → divisible by 3
> print(14 % 5) # 4 → remainder 4, not divisible by 5
> ```

## **5. Loops Style Guide**

#### 1. Use Descriptive Variable Names
Good or bad?
```python
for x in y:
   print(x)
```

```python
for fruit in fruits:
   print(fruit)
```
#### 2. Use Local Variables for Accumulators


Use local variables inside functions to store results:


```python
def total(numbers_list):
   total_sum = 0
   for num in numbers_list:
       total_sum += num
   return total_sum
```


#### 3. Keep Loops Readable


* Indent properly
* Use spaces around operators
* Keep one idea per loop


#### 4. Avoid Mutating the Original List


If building a new list, **append to a new one** instead of changing the old one:


```python
def all_evens(numbers_list):
   evens = [] #local, non mutating= GOOD
   for num in numbers_list:
       if num % 2 == 0:
           evens.append(num)
   return evens


print(all_evens([1,4,5,6,8,9])    )
```
