20.4.11 Assign: Ninety-nine Bottles
```


## **Project Overview**


You will create 2 versions of a Python program that prints the lyrics to the classic song **"99 Bottles of Pop/Beer on the Wall"**.


1.  Start by using a **`for` loop** to handle the countdown.
2. Then modify the program to use **user input** and a **`while` loop**.

## **File Setup**


* Name your file: `NinetyNineBottles.py`

> [!TIP]
> Avoid starting the filename with a number, as it can cause errors in the universe



## **Requirements**


### **1. Good Coding Practices (10%)**


* Follow proper **style guidelines**:


 * Correct indentation
 * Meaningful variable names
 * User-friendly prompts
 * Use **comments** to explain your code
* Both versions of your program should be contained in **separate functions**.
* Include a comment explaining your `for` loop:


 * How it counts backwards
 * The meaning of the arguments
* Use **f-strings** to format output:


 ```python
 bottles = 99
 print(f"{bottles} bottles of beer on the wall.")
 ```


---


### **2. Basic `for` Loop Lyrics (50%)**


* Write a function called `forLyrics` that holds a `for` loop that counts down from **99 to 0** and prints the lyrics.


* Each verse should dynamically include the **current number of bottles**.


* Example format:


 ```plaintext
 99 bottles of beer on the wall,
 99 bottles of beer.
 Take one down, pass it around,
 98 bottles of beer on the wall.
 ```


* Ending of the song................. hint:


 ```plaintext
 1 bottle of beer on the wall,
 1 bottle of beer.
 Take one down, pass it around,
 0 bottles of beer on the wall.
 ```


---


### **3. Grammar Correction (10%)**


* Adjust the lyrics when there is **1 bottle**:


 * Change "bottles" → "bottle"
 * there are a few ways to do this.
* If there are **0 bottles**, print:


 > "There are no bottles of beer on the wall"


---


### **4. User Input for Age and Preferences (20%)**
Write a function called `main` that takes in information from your user
1. their age
2. Depending on their age, their preference for a drink
* **Ask the user for their age**:


 * If age ≥ 18:


   * Ask their preference: `"pop"` or `"beer"`
   * Pass this choice into your function using arguments/parameters to alter the the lyrics:


     > "99 Bottles of Pop on the Wall" or "99 Bottles of Beer on the Wall"
 * If age < 18:


   * Default to `"Pop"` without asking
* Ensure the lyrics reflect the user’s **drink choice**.


* *hint* remember default parameter, you will need to edit your lyric functions


---


### **5. Stage 4: While Loop Version with User Input (10%)**
Write a function called `whileLyrics` and have it do the following:
* Create a **second version** of the program using a **`while` loop**.
* Prompt the user to **enter a starting number of bottles**.
* The countdown and age-based drink preference should function the same as in the `for` loop version.
* reminder, this one should also take in parameters for age and drink prefference.
* edit your `main` function to ask which version your user would like to use, `whileLyrics` or `forLyrics`


---


### **Hints**


* There is a way to count backwards using **For Loop Syntax** im more than confident you can count backward with a for loop using `range()`
* While Loop Syntax, you will need a counter as a local variable
* **f-strings Example:**


 ```python
 bottles = 5
 print(f"{bottles} bottles of pop on the wall.")
 ```
