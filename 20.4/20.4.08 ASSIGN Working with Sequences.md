20.4.08 Assign: Working with Sequences
```




## **TODO**
For each exercise below:


1. Write a **function** that performs the described operation on a given sequence (list, string, etc.).
2. Copy the **test function** provided for each exercise into your file.
3. Run the test only at the end of your assignment in a function called `testing()`. Write everything FIRST and then make a master test function that runs ALL the asserts at once


---


## **TODO**


1. **First Item**
  Write a function named `first` that takes in a sequence (string or list) and returns the **first value** of that sequence.


  ```python
  def firstTest():  
     assert first("ubuntu") == "u"
     assert first([1, 2, 3]) == 1
     assert first(["python", "is", "awesome"]) == "python"
     print("Exercise 1 is correct.")
  ```


2. **Second Item**
  Write a function named `second` that takes in a sequence and returns the **second value** of that sequence.


  ```python
  def secondTest():
     assert second("ubuntu") == "b"
     assert second([1, 2, 3]) == 2
     assert second(["python", "is", "awesome"]) == "is"
     print("Exercise 2 is correct.")
  ```


3. **Third Item**
  Write a function named `third` that takes in a sequence and returns the **third value** of that sequence.


  ```python
  def thirdTest():
     assert third("ubuntu") == "u"
     assert third([1, 2, 3]) == 3
     assert third(["python", "is", "awesome"]) == "awesome"
     print("Exercise 3 is correct.")
  ```


4. **Last Item**
  Write a function named `last` that takes in a sequence and returns the **last value** of that sequence.
  *Hint:* You can use a **negative index** to access items from the end of a list or string.


  ```python
  def lastTest():  
     assert last("ubuntu") == "u"
     assert last([1, 2, 3, 4]) == 4
     assert last(["python", "is", "awesome"]) == "awesome"
     assert last(["kiwi", "mango", "guava"]) == "guava"
     print("Exercise 4 is correct.")
  ```


5. **Second to Last Item**
  Write a function named `second_to_last` that takes in a sequence and returns the **second to last value** of that sequence.


  ```python
  def second_to_lastTest():  
     assert second_to_last("ubuntu") == "t"
     assert second_to_last([1, 2, 3, 4]) == 3
     assert second_to_last(["python", "is", "awesome"]) == "is"
     assert second_to_last(["kiwi", "mango", "guava"]) == "mango"
     print("Exercise 5 is correct.")
  ```


6. **Sum of All Numbers**
  Write a function named `sum_all` that takes in a sequence of numbers and returns the **sum of all numbers**.


  ```python
  def sum_allTest():   
     assert sum_all([1, 2, 3, 4]) == 10
     assert sum_all([3, 3, 3]) == 9
     assert sum_all([0, 5, 6]) == 11
     print("Exercise 6 is correct.")
  ```


7. **Mean (Average)**
  Write a function named `mean` that takes in a sequence of numbers and returns the **average (mean)** value.
  *Hint:* Divide the sum of the sequence by its length using `len()`.


  ```python
  def meanTest():
     assert mean([1, 2, 3, 4]) == 2.5
     assert mean([3, 3, 3]) == 3
     assert mean([1, 5, 6]) == 4
     print("Exercise 7 is correct.")
  ```




8. **Write a Master Test Function**
   Create a function named `testing` that **calls all the individual test functions**. Use this function to run all your tests at once and verify that all exercises are correct.
