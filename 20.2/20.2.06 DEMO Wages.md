```
**Things to focus on:**
* Using arrays to store hours worked
* Using a for loop to show a list vertically
* how to make the SUM algo using lists and for loop
    * this will be on a test
* how to add hours to your list

## Starter
```JS
let wage = 13.50;
let allShifts = [];

function setup() {
	createCanvas(800, 600);
//Two ways to add data to an array 
//1. By index number
//2. By PUSH, which adds to the end of the array. Look for push in mousePressed

    allShifts[0] = 4;
    allShifts[1] = 6;

}//end setup

function draw() {
    background(200,200,80);
    textSize(20);
    text("Hours Worked", 50, 50);
    text("Dollars Earned", 250, 50);
    
    /* 
    we want to look through your list and see each day on the screen
    - This for loop is not finished, how to do you know how many loops to make?
    */
    //for( let i=0;       ;  i++ ){


   // }//end of for
  
    /*
    How to figure out the sum Algorithm 
    -you need to know how to do this for a test
    */
    let sum = 0; //local
   // for( let i = 0;                ; i++  ){  //im so broken. 


   // }// end of for
    text("Total Earned $" + (sum*wage), 400, 200   );
   
}//end draw


function mousePressed() {
    //let tempHours = window.prompt("How many hours did you work?") 
    //allShifts.push(tempHours);
}//end mousePressed
