20.2.08 Assign: Tracking Inventory
```
> [!TIP]
> **Note to future me:** Review how to use conditionals with `.includes()`


While this assignment follows the theme of a game, it is not an actual game. The user has no choices, and it progresses linearly. However, it should inspire ideas for future game development.


The focus of this assignment is manipulating arrays. You must demonstrate your ability to use `push()` and `splice()`.


- **Array methods documentation:** Find information on [`push()` and `splice()` here](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_array_methods.asp).


## Structure of the Program


- The program consists of 11 scenes. Each scene is displayed sequentially when the mouse is clicked.
- Create a `sceneNum` variable and modify your `draw` function to call the appropriate scene functions.
- In `mousePressed`, simply increment `sceneNum` and set a flag variable. The flag variable will be discussed in class.


## Set Up the Following Global Variables:
- An `inventory` array.
- Starter inventory contains: `water`, `knife`, `shield`, `hat`.
- A `coins` variable. The program starts with `10` coins.




## The Scenes


> [!IMPORTANT]
> ## In Every Scene, You Will:
> - Display a sentence or two about the story.
> - Add an `if` statement to ensure that an update happens only once
> - Display the `inventory` array after any updates occur.
> - Display the current number of coins.



### Scene 1
Something has caused a monster apocalypse. Write a few sentences to introduce the story.
You may add an image to the first scene but not to the others unless you have extra time.


### Scene 2
You meet a kind old woman on the street who gives you a map and 5 coins to help with your quest.
 * Use the `push()` function to add the map to your inventory and increase your coin count by 5.
   * if you have a million maps... use an if `.includes`
   * Congrats you created an infinite money glitch.
Use this code to prevent duplicates:


   ```js
   if (!inventory.includes('map')) {
     inventory.push('map');
     coins += 5;
   }
   ```


### Scene 3
You encounter a terrifying ____. You win the battle, but your shield is destroyed in the process.
* Use `splice()` to remove the shield from your inventory.


### Scene 4
Feeling hungry, you enter an abandoned restaurant and gather supplies.
You decide to keep your food and water supplies at the beginning of the list.
* Use `splice()` to insert two food items at index 1 in your inventory.


> **Check your work:** Your first three inventory items should now be food items like `water`, `hot dog`, `pizza pocket`.


### Scene 5
You find a small group of hungry children. You check your supplies but decide to keep everything for yourself.
* Display your full inventory as usual.
* Then separately, display only the first three items of your inventory, all your food.


Taunt the children with a message like: *"Look at what we have, and you don’t… muahahahaha!"*




### Scene 6
Your choice. Use `push()` or `splice()` in a meaningful way.


### Scene 7
You meet a blacksmith who offers to sell you a magical sword.
* Spend 5 coins and add the sword to your inventory.


### Scene 8
You fall asleep, and when you wake up, you notice fresh footprints nearby.
* Use `splice()` to remove the water from your inventory.


### Scene 9
Your choice. Use an `if` statement in a meaningful way.


### Scene 10
You confront the Queen Monster in an epic battle. You save the world, but your weapons are destroyed.
* Use `splice()` to remove your weapons from the inventory.


### Scene 11
The End.

## Starter Code


```js
let inventory = ["water", "knife", "shield", "hat"];
let sceneNum = 1;


function setup() {
 createCanvas(800, 600);
} // end setup


function mousePressed() {
 sceneNum++;
} // end mousePressed


function draw() {
 background(242, 48, 101);
 if (sceneNum === 1) {
   scene1();
 }
 if (sceneNum === 2) {
   scene2();
 }
} // end draw


function scene1() {
 text(`Scene ${sceneNum}`, 300, 40);
 textSize(15);
 text("Welcome, intrepid hero! A treacherous member of the King’s Council has released hordes of bloodthirsty monsters into the kingdom. As a member of the Hero’s Guild, it is your duty to protect the realm from mystical threats.", 20, 450);
 text("Inventory: " + inventory, 20, 550);
 text("Coins: " + coins, 20, 565);
} // end scene1


function scene2() {
 text(`Scene ${sceneNum}`, 300, 40);// make this show in every scene
 textSize(15);
 text("Scene 2", 20, 450);
} // end scene2
