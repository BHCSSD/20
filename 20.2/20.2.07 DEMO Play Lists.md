20.2.07 Demo Play Lists
```
> **Outcomes:**
> 
> * **1.2.1 Static arrays (parallel arrays):** Creating two separate lists  `bands` and `genres` that "line up" because they share the same index numbers.
> * **1.2.3 Arrays types; e.g., single dimensional arrays (lists), double dimensional arrays (tables) and parallel arrays (look-up or associative tables)**
> * **1.3.3 Searching, finding and retrieving data (Filtering):** Combining a for loop with an if statement to search for and only display data that matches a specific "filter."

**Things to focus on:**
* Learn how to use **parallel lists** (arrays that line up together)
* Use a `for` loop to display all items in a list 
* Combine a `for` loop with an `if()` to make a **filtered printing** (only showing data that matches a rule).


> [!NOTE]
> ## INFODUMP:
> Parallel Lists
> 
> * A **list** (array) holds multiple pieces of data.
>   ```js
>   let bands = ["Drake", "Dua Lipa", "The Weeknd"];
>   ```
> 
> * A **parallel list** means you have **two lists with matching positions**.
>   ```js
>   let bands = ["Drake", "Dua Lipa", "The Weeknd"];
>   let genres = ["Hip Hop", "Pop", "R&B"];
>   ```
> 
>   Here, `bands[0]` goes with `genres[0]`.
>   → Drake = Hip Hop
>   → Dua Lipa = Pop
>   → The Weeknd = R&B

## Starter Code

```javascript
let allBands = [];
let allGenres = [];
let filter = "";

function setup() {
  createCanvas(800, 600);
//adding  items to the array by index number
  allBands[0] = "Justin Bieber";
  allBands[1] = "Ed Sheeran";
  allBands[2] = "The Weeknd";
  allBands[3] = "Dua Lipa";
  allBands[4] = "Drake";
  allBands[5] = "J Balvin";

  allGenres[0] = "Pop";
  allGenres[1] = "Pop";
  allGenres[2] = "R&B";
  allGenres[3] = "Pop";
  allGenres[4] = "Hip Hop";
  allGenres[5] = "Hip Hop";

  // Ask user what they want to see
  filter = window.prompt("What genre do you want to search for?");
}

function draw() {
  background(200, 200, 80);
  textSize(20);

  // Show all bands + genres
  for (let i = 0; i < allBands.length; i++) {
    text(allBands[i] + "     " + allGenres[i], 50, i * 30 + 100);
  }

  // Show filtered results
  //this is what you need to know
  text("Bands in " + filter, 400, 100);
  for (let i=0; i<allBands.length; i++) {
    if (allGenres[i] === filter) {//only show the band if they match the Genres
      text(allBands[i], 400, i * 30 + 130);
    }//end if
  }//end for
}//end draw
```

### What’s Happening

| Code                           | Explanation                                           |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `allBands` + `allGenres`       | Two **parallel lists** that match band → genre        |
| `for` loop                     | Goes through each list position                       |
| `if (allGenres[i] === filter)` | Checks if that band’s genre matches the user’s choice |
| `window.prompt()`              | Lets you type a genre to search for                   |

> [!TIP]
>If nothing shows up, make sure your **filter matches exactly** (like `"Pop"` not `"pop"`). You can use `.toLowerCase()` later to make it more flexible.
