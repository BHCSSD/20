# **20.2.09 Assign: Funds**
```
20.2.09 Assign: Funds
```


For this assignment:
* You must **write all code from scratch** (no starter file).
* All **math happens inside functions** with **return values**.
* Only display information in`draw()`
   * **no** displaying info in your math functions or `mousePressed`
* Keep your output **clear, labeled, and well formatted.**
---


## **1. Setup Your Data (20%)**


1. Create **three parallel arrays** with data for **10 students**:


  * `names[]` → list of student names (James must be the 8th index)
  * `funds[]` → total money raised ( 0-500, all different)
       * Ensure at least some students raised less than $40 (this will be used in Step 2).
  * `forms[]` → whether they turned in their permission form (`true` / `false`)


2. **Half** of the permission form values should be `true`, and the other half `false`.


---


## **2. Show the Data**


Use **one `for` loop** to print each student’s information on one line:


* Name
* Funds raised
* Permission status (`true` or `false`)


**Example Output:**


```
Alex - $125 - true 
Sam - $35 - false 
Jamie - $210 - true
```


---


## **3. Analyze the Fundraiser (60%)**


You’ll write several **math-based functions** that work with your arrays.


### Function Rules:


* Each must **return** a number or true/false: no `text()` inside
* You need to use local variables inside the function
* These functions are called from `draw()` to display results.
* No drawing or text commands inside any math function.


---


### **3.1 Total and Average Algorithms (20%)**


Write the following two functions:


1. **`function total(funds)`**
  * Takes in the array funds
  * Loops through the `funds[]` array
  * Returns the **total** of all amounts raised


2. **`function average(funds)`**
  * Takes in the array funds
  * Uses the total from `total(funds)`
  * Returns the **average amount raised** per student


**Example Output:**


```
Total raised: $2150 
Average per student: $215
```


---


### **3.2 CountIF Algorithm (20%)**


Write the following two functions:
1. **`function countLow(funds)`**


  * Counts how many students raised **less than $40**
  * Returns that **count**


2. **`function bottleDrive(count)`**
  * If `count <= 2`, return `false`
  * If `count > 2`, return `true`


Use these two together in `draw()` to decide whether the Bottle Drive is required.


**Example Output:**


```
Students below $40: 3 
Bottle Drive is this Saturday
```


---


### **3.3 Highest Fundraiser Algorithm (20%)**


Write the following function:


1. **`function highest(funds)`**


  * Finds the **index** of the highest fundraiser
  * Returns that index


2. Then, in `draw()`, use the index to show both:
  * The **name** (`names[index]`)
  * The **amount** (`funds[index]`)


**Example Output:**


```
Our highest fundraiser was Jamie, who raised $490.
```


---


### **4.1 SUMIF: Eligible Funds (10%)**
Only students who submitted their permission forms can attend the event.
Write one function:


1. **`function sumIf(funds, forms)`**
  * takes in 2 arrays `funds`,`forms`
  * Loops through both arrays
  * Adds up the **funds** for students whose `forms[]` value is `true`
  * Returns that total


**Example Output:**


```
Funds raised by those with permission: $1250
```


*Hint:*
This works like `total()`, but has an `if` condition inside the loop.


---


### **4.2 Door Prize (10%)**


Write one function:


1. **`function randomWinner(names)`**


  * Chooses a random index using `floor(arr)`
  * Returns the **name** at that index


In `mousePressed()`, call this function to print the result.


**Example Output:**


```
[mouse clicked] This door prize goes to: Alex 
[mouse clicked] This door prize goes to: Sam
```
